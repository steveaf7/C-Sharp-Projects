### TwentyOne/Casino
This was a very fun, challenging, and engaging project that taught me all about the C# language, and I gained experience creating classes and objects that represent real life.  This was great chance to practice writing more complex logic, using loops, managing data types, debugging, and encapsulation. TwentyOne includes the basic program, and references the Casino namespace, which is where the vast majority of the logic, and methods were built. The Casino namespace was built to be general enough so we could add more casino games in the future. As I learned on this course, it is a good idea to make your classes as general as possible, as this fosters code reusability. 

### CarInsurance
This is a simple MVC app where the user inputs information that a car insurance company would ask for, and then calculates quote based on that information. This information is saved to a database, and an admin can log in and view quotes created to follow up with customers. I created a method for this called CalculateQuote, so I could call it in multiple areas of the app, for instance, I set it up so that when edits are made to user information, the quote is recalculated based on that new information. 

### Final Challenge Submisson
This is a challenge where I was asked to create a databse with the entity framework using the code first model. It is a simple console application that, at runtime, creates a new database based on the student model, instantiates a student object, and performs a query on the database using LINQ, printing the object to the screen.
